Looking at these diagnostic plots, here's what they reveal about your linear regression model:

**Residuals vs Fitted (top left):** The residuals show clear non-linear patterns with the red LOESS curve displaying a pronounced U-shape. This indicates **heteroscedasticity** and suggests the linear model may be misspecified. The residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, but instead show systematic patterns that suggest a non-linear relationship might be more appropriate.

**Normal Q-Q Plot (top right):** The standardized residuals follow the theoretical normal line reasonably well in the center, but show significant deviations in both tails. The heavy tails (especially the upper tail) indicate the residuals are **not normally distributed**, likely showing heavier tails than a normal distribution would predict.

**Scale-Location (bottom left):** This plot shows the square root of standardized residuals vs fitted values. The red line shows a clear downward trend, confirming **heteroscedasticity** - the variance of residuals changes systematically with the fitted values. This violates the constant variance assumption of linear regression.

**Residuals vs Leverage (bottom right):** Several points show high leverage (observations 6, 8, 10), and there are points with large standardized residuals. The Cook's distance contours (red dashed lines) help identify influential observations. Points outside these contours would be highly influential on the regression results.

**Recommendations:**

1. Consider **transformation** of the response variable or predictors
2. Explore **non-linear regression** methods or polynomial terms
3. Investigate **robust regression** techniques to handle the non-normal residuals
4. Examine the **high-leverage points** more closely to determine if they're outliers or contain important information

The model appears to have systematic issues that suggest the linear relationship assumption may not be appropriate for this data.

You're right - the robust regression diagnostics don't show much improvement over the original OLS model. Both sets of plots still exhibit the same fundamental issues:

**Persistent Problems:**

- **Non-linearity**: The residuals vs fitted plots still show the same curved pattern in the LOWESS line
- **Heteroscedasticity**: The scale-location plots continue to show non-constant variance
- **Non-normality**: The Q-Q plots still show heavy tails and departure from normality
- **Influential observations**: The same problematic points (6, 8) remain

**Why robust regression isn't helping:** Robust regression primarily addresses **outliers** and **heavy-tailed errors**, but your main issues appear to be:

1. **Model misspecification** - the linear relationship assumption is violated
2. **Systematic patterns** in residuals suggesting missing non-linear terms

**Better approaches to try:**

1. **Transformation of variables:**

```other
# Try log transformation of response or predictors
```

@formula(log(margin) ~ HS_pct + BA_pct + GRAD_pct)

1. **Polynomial or interaction terms:**

```other
@formula(margin ~ HS_pct + BA_pct + GRAD_pct + HS_pct^2 + BA_pct^2)
```

1. **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)** using smoothing splines:

```other
# With MLJ.jl or similar packages
```

1. **Check for multicollinearity** between your education variables (HS_pct, BA_pct, GRAD_pct)

The issue isn't outliers - it's that a linear model fundamentally doesn't capture the true relationship in your data. You need either variable transformations or a more flexible model structure.

The VIF results show **moderate to high multicollinearity**:

- **HS_pct**: VIF = 1.37 (fine - no collinearity issues)
- **BA_pct**: VIF = 9.81 (high - approaching the VIF > 10 threshold)
- **GRAD_pct**: VIF = 8.78 (high - significant collinearity)

**BA_pct and GRAD_pct are highly collinear**, which makes sense because:

- Both represent higher education levels
- Areas with high bachelor's degree rates often have high graduate degree rates
- They likely move together across geographic regions

**Options to address this:**

**1. Drop one variable (simplest):**

```other
# Try model with just HS_pct and BA_pct
model1 = lm(@formula(margin ~ HS_pct + BA_pct), df)

# Or HS_pct and GRAD_pct  
model2 = lm(@formula(margin ~ HS_pct + GRAD_pct), df)
```

**2. Combine the collinear variables:**

```other
# Create total higher education variable
df.higher_ed = df.BA_pct + df.GRAD_pct
model3 = lm(@formula(margin ~ HS_pct + higher_ed), df)
```

**3. Use Ridge regression to handle collinearity:**

```other
using MLJ, MLJLinearModels

# Ridge regression naturally handles multicollinearity
ridge = RidgeRegressor()
```

Given your diagnostic plots showed systematic non-linearity rather than just outlier issues, the multicollinearity between BA_pct and GRAD_pct is likely contributing to model instability. Try option 1 or 2 first, then recheck your diagnostic plots to see if the residual patterns improve.

**Significant improvement!** Removing the collinear variable (GRAD_pct) has helped considerably:

**Residuals vs Fitted (top left):** The red LOWESS line is much **flatter and closer to zero** across most of the fitted value range. The severe U-shaped pattern from before is largely gone, though there's still some slight curvature. This indicates the linearity assumption is much better satisfied.

**Normal Q-Q Plot (top right):** **Substantially improved normality**. The points follow the theoretical line much more closely in the center and lower tail. The upper tail still shows some deviation (points 6, 8), but overall much better than before.

**Scale-Location (bottom left):** **Major improvement in homoscedasticity**. The red line is much flatter, indicating more constant variance across fitted values. The dramatic downward trend from the original model is mostly resolved.

**Residuals vs Leverage (bottom right):** Similar leverage structure, but the residuals appear more randomly distributed around zero.

**Key takeaway:** The multicollinearity between BA_pct and GRAD_pct was significantly contributing to the model's poor diagnostics. By removing GRAD_pct, you've:

- Eliminated the severe non-linearity pattern
- Greatly improved homoscedasticity
- Achieved much better residual normality

**Next steps:**

- Check model summary statistics (R², coefficients, p-values)
- This reduced model appears much more reliable for inference
- You could still explore minor improvements like polynomial terms for the remaining slight curvature, but the current model is substantially better

The collinearity was masking the true relationships and creating instability in the model fit.

**Interpreting the Ridge Regression Results:**

**Cross-Validation Results:**

- **Best λ = 1,394,626**: This is a **very high regularization parameter**, indicating strong shrinkage is needed
- **Mean loss = 432,473,707,036**: This is the cross-validated mean squared error - quite large, suggesting the model still struggles with prediction
- The high lambda suggests severe multicollinearity that requires substantial coefficient shrinkage

**Model Performance:**

- **pct_dev = 0.145944 (14.59%)**: The model explains only **~14.6% of the variance** - this is quite low
- **df = 3**: All 3 predictors remain in the model (ridge doesn't set coefficients to zero like lasso)

**Residual Analysis:** Looking at your residuals, there are some **extremely large values**:

- Residual of **-3.19 million** and **1.49 million** indicate severe prediction errors
- Most residuals are in the hundreds of thousands range

**What this suggests:**

1. **Ridge isn't solving the fundamental problem** - you still have very large prediction errors
2. **The linear model assumption may still be violated** - even with regularization
3. **The high lambda indicates your predictors are highly redundant** but still not capturing the true relationship

**Next steps:**

```other
# Check the actual coefficients to see the shrinkage effect
coeffs = coef(ridge_final)
println("Ridge coefficients: ", coeffs)

# Compare with original OLS for the same variables
ols_full = lm(@formula(margin ~ HS_pct + BA_pct + GRAD_pct), df)
println("OLS coefficients: ", coef(ols_full))

# The ridge coefficients should be much smaller (shrunk toward zero)
```

**Conclusion:** Ridge regression confirms that multicollinearity was a problem (hence the high lambda), but the fundamental issue appears to be **model misspecification** rather than just collinearity. The low explained variance (14.6%) and large residuals suggest you need a different modeling approach - possibly transformations, polynomial terms, or a completely different model structure.

Your earlier finding that dropping one collinear variable improved diagnostics significantly may be the better approach than ridge regression here.

Spatial correlation in regression requires specialized approaches. Here are the main methods in Julia:

**1. Spatial Error Model (SEM) / Spatial Lag Model (SLM):**

```other
using SpatialDependence, LibPQ, DataFrames

# Connect to PostGIS and get spatial weights
conn = LibPQ.Connection("host=localhost dbname=yourdb user=user")

# Create spatial weights matrix from your geometries
# Option A: Queen/Rook contiguity
query = """
SELECT a.id, b.id as neighbor_id
FROM your_table a, your_table b  
WHERE a.id != b.id 
AND ST_Touches(a.geom, b.geom)  -- or ST_Intersects for Queen
"""

neighbors = execute(conn, query) |> DataFrame

# Option B: Distance-based weights  
query = """
SELECT a.id, b.id as neighbor_id, 
       ST_Distance(a.geom, b.geom) as distance
FROM your_table a, your_table b
WHERE a.id != b.id 
AND ST_DWithin(a.geom, b.geom, 50000)  -- 50km threshold
"""

# Convert to spatial weights matrix W
W = create_spatial_weights(neighbors)  # You'll need to implement this

# Fit spatial lag model: y = ρWy + Xβ + ε
spatial_model = fit_spatial_lag(y, X, W)

# Or spatial error model: y = Xβ + u, u = λWu + ε  
spatial_error_model = fit_spatial_error(y, X, W)
```

**2. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR):**

```other
using GeoStats

# Get coordinates from PostGIS
coords_query = """
SELECT id, ST_X(geom) as x, ST_Y(geom) as y, 
       margin, HS_pct, BA_pct, GRAD_pct
FROM your_table
"""
spatial_df = execute(conn, coords_query) |> DataFrame

# Create georeferenced data
coords = [(row.x, row.y) for row in eachrow(spatial_df)]
geodata = georef((margin=spatial_df.margin, 
                 HS_pct=spatial_df.HS_pct,
                 BA_pct=spatial_df.BA_pct,
                 GRAD_pct=spatial_df.GRAD_pct), coords)

# Fit GWR (estimates separate coefficients for each location)
gwr_model = GWR(geodata, :margin ~ :HS_pct + :BA_pct + :GRAD_pct)
```

**3. Mixed Effects with Spatial Random Effects:**

```other
using MixedModels, Distances

# Get coordinate matrix
coords_query = """
SELECT ST_X(geom) as x, ST_Y(geom) as y 
FROM your_table ORDER BY id
"""
coords_df = execute(conn, coords_query) |> DataFrame
coords_matrix = Matrix(coords_df)

# Create distance matrix and spatial correlation structure
dist_matrix = pairwise(Euclidean(), coords_matrix', dims=2)

# Spatial mixed model (you may need custom implementation)
# This is conceptual - exact syntax depends on available packages
spatial_mixed = fit(MixedModel, 
                   @formula(margin ~ HS_pct + BA_pct + (1|spatial_id)), 
                   df, spatial_covariance=exponential_decay(dist_matrix))
```

**4. Simple Distance-Based Correction:**

```other
# Calculate distances between all observations
function haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
    # Haversine formula implementation
    R = 6371  # Earth's radius in km
    # ... implementation
end

# Get all pairwise distances from PostGIS
distance_query = """
SELECT a.id as id1, b.id as id2,
       ST_Distance(a.geom::geography, b.geom::geography)/1000 as dist_km
FROM your_table a 
CROSS JOIN your_table b
WHERE a.id < b.id
"""

# Use distances to weight observations or cluster standard errors
```

**5. Robust Standard Errors with Spatial Clustering:**

```other
using CovarianceMatrices

# Cluster standard errors by spatial proximity
# Define spatial clusters based on distance threshold
function create_spatial_clusters(coords, threshold_km)
    # Implementation to group nearby observations
end

clusters = create_spatial_clusters(coords_matrix, 100)  # 100km clusters

# Robust standard errors clustered by spatial groups
robust_se = vcov(model, SpatialCluster(clusters))
```

**Recommended approach:**

1. Start with **Moran's I test** to confirm spatial autocorrelation exists
2. If significant, use **Spatial Error Model** or **GWR** depending on whether you expect coefficients to vary spatially
3. For complex geometries, PostGIS spatial functions are very powerful for creating proper spatial weights

Which approach interests you most, or do you have a specific spatial structure in mind (contiguous regions, point locations, etc.)?

Eventually, I'd like to visualize the effects of spatial autocorrelation

For visualizing spatial autocorrelation effects, you'll want to create several types of maps and plots. Here's a comprehensive approach:

**1. Basic Spatial Data Setup:**

```other
using Plots, StatsPlots, PlotlyJS
using LibPQ, DataFrames
using Colors, ColorSchemes

# Get spatial data with geometries from PostGIS
query = """
SELECT id, margin, HS_pct, BA_pct, GRAD_pct,
       ST_AsText(geom) as wkt,
       ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as x,
       ST_Y(ST_Centroid(geom)) as y
FROM your_table
ORDER BY id
"""
spatial_df = execute(conn, query) |> DataFrame
```

**2. Residual Maps (Before/After Spatial Correction):**

```other
# Calculate residuals from your original model
ols_residuals = residuals(your_ols_model)

# After spatial correction (example with spatial lag model)
spatial_residuals = residuals(your_spatial_model)

# Create side-by-side residual maps
function plot_residual_map(x, y, residuals, title)
    scatter(x, y, 
           marker_z=residuals,
           color=:RdBu,
           markersize=6,
           title=title,
           colorbar_title="Residuals")
end

p1 = plot_residual_map(spatial_df.x, spatial_df.y, ols_residuals, "OLS Residuals")
p2 = plot_residual_map(spatial_df.x, spatial_df.y, spatial_residuals, "Spatial Model Residuals")

plot(p1, p2, layout=(1,2), size=(1000, 400))
```

**3. Moran's I Scatterplot:**

```other
function morans_i_plot(values, spatial_weights_matrix)
    # Calculate spatial lag
    spatial_lag = spatial_weights_matrix * values
    
    # Standardize both
    std_values = (values .- mean(values)) ./ std(values)
    std_lag = (spatial_lag .- mean(spatial_lag)) ./ std(spatial_lag)
    
    # Create scatterplot
    scatter(std_values, std_lag,
           xlabel="Standardized Values",
           ylabel="Spatially Lagged Values", 
           title="Moran's I Scatterplot",
           alpha=0.6)
    
    # Add regression line
    plot!(x -> x, color=:red, linewidth=2, label="y=x line")
    
    # Calculate and display Moran's I
    morans_i = cor(std_values, std_lag)
    annotate!(0.7, -0.8, text("Moran's I = $(round(morans_i, digits=3))", 12))
end
```

**4. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Map:**

```other
function lisa_map(values, coords, spatial_weights)
    # Calculate local Moran's I for each observation
    local_morans = calculate_local_morans(values, spatial_weights)
    
    # Classify into High-High, Low-Low, High-Low, Low-High
    mean_val = mean(values)
    classifications = map(1:length(values)) do i
        val = values[i]
        lag_val = sum(spatial_weights[i, :] .* values)
        
        if val > mean_val && lag_val > mean_val
            "High-High"
        elseif val < mean_val && lag_val < mean_val  
            "Low-Low"
        elseif val > mean_val && lag_val < mean_val
            "High-Low"
        else
            "Low-High"
        end
    end
    
    # Color mapping
    color_map = Dict("High-High" => :red, "Low-Low" => :blue, 
                    "High-Low" => :pink, "Low-High" => :lightblue)
    colors = [color_map[c] for c in classifications]
    
    scatter(coords[:, 1], coords[:, 2], 
           color=colors,
           markersize=8,
           title="LISA Cluster Map",
           legend=:topright)
end
```

**5. Variogram/Correlogram Plot:**

```other
using Distances

function spatial_correlogram(residuals, coords, max_dist=200, n_bins=20)
    # Calculate all pairwise distances
    distances = pairwise(Euclidean(), coords', dims=2)
    
    # Bin distances
    dist_bins = range(0, max_dist, length=n_bins+1)
    bin_centers = (dist_bins[1:end-1] + dist_bins[2:end]) / 2
    
    correlations = Float64[]
    
    for i in 1:n_bins
        # Find pairs in this distance bin
        in_bin = (distances .>= dist_bins[i]) .& (distances .< dist_bins[i+1])
        
        if sum(in_bin) > 10  # Need enough pairs
            pairs_resid1 = residuals[in_bin]
            pairs_resid2 = residuals[in_bin']  # Note transpose for pairing
            correlation = cor(pairs_resid1, pairs_resid2)
        else
            correlation = NaN
        end
        
        push!(correlations, correlation)
    end
    
    plot(bin_centers, correlations,
         xlabel="Distance (km)",
         ylabel="Spatial Correlation",
         title="Spatial Correlogram",
         linewidth=2,
         marker=:circle)
    hline!([0], color=:red, linestyle=:dash, label="No Correlation")
end
```

**6. Interactive Choropleth Maps (if you have polygon geometries):**

```other
using PlotlyJS

function interactive_choropleth(spatial_df, variable_col, title)
    # This assumes you can convert WKT to polygon coordinates
    # You may need additional geometry processing
    
    plot(spatial_df, 
         type="choropleth",
         z=spatial_df[!, variable_col],
         colorscale="Viridis",
         showscale=true,
         title=title)
end

# Show original variable
interactive_choropleth(spatial_df, :margin, "Margin Values")

# Show residuals  
spatial_df.ols_residuals = ols_residuals
interactive_choropleth(spatial_df, :ols_residuals, "OLS Residuals")
```

**7. Combined Visualization Dashboard:**

```other
function spatial_analysis_dashboard(spatial_df, ols_model, spatial_model)
    # Calculate residuals
    ols_resid = residuals(ols_model)
    spatial_resid = residuals(spatial_model)
    
    # Create subplot layout
    p1 = plot_residual_map(spatial_df.x, spatial_df.y, ols_resid, "OLS Residuals")
    p2 = plot_residual_map(spatial_df.x, spatial_df.y, spatial_resid, "Spatial Model Residuals")
    p3 = spatial_correlogram(ols_resid, Matrix(spatial_df[!, [:x, :y]]))
    p4 = morans_i_plot(ols_resid, spatial_weights_matrix)
    
    plot(p1, p2, p3, p4, layout=(2,2), size=(1200, 800))
end
```

**Key visualizations to create:**

1. **Choropleth maps** of raw data and residuals
2. **Moran's I scatterplot** showing spatial clustering
3. **LISA cluster maps** identifying spatial outliers
4. **Correlograms** showing how correlation decays with distance
5. **Before/after maps** comparing OLS vs spatial model residuals

This will clearly show whether spatial autocorrelation exists, where it's strongest, and how well your spatial model addresses it.
